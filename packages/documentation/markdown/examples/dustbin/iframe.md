This is the same simple example, but nested in an iframe.

When you are using the [react-dnd-html5-backend](/docs/backends/html5), you are limited to
drag-and-drop within a single HTML document.

Using react-dnd inside of an iframe requires using a [DndProvider](/docs/api/dnd-provider) within the iframe.

<view-source name="01-dustbin/single-target-in-iframe" component="dustbin-single-target-in-iframe">
</view-source>
