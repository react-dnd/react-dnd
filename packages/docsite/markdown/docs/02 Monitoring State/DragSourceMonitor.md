# DragSourceMonitor

`DragSourceMonitor` is an object passed to a collecting function of a [dragging source](/docs/api/use-drag). Its methods let you get information about the drag state of a specific drag source. The specific drag source bound to that monitor is called the monitor's _owner_ below.

### Methods

- **`canDrag()`**: Returns `true` if no drag operation is in progress, and the owner's `canDrag()` returns `true` or is not defined.

- **`isDragging()`**: Returns `true` if a drag operation is in progress, and either the owner initiated the drag, or its `isDragging()` is defined and returns `true`.

- **`getItemType()`**: Returns a string or a symbol identifying the type of the current dragged item. Returns `null` if no item is being dragged.

- **`getItem()`**: Returns a plain object representing the currently dragged item. Every drag source must specify it by returning an object from its `beginDrag()` method. Returns `null` if no item is being dragged.

- **`getDropResult()`**: Returns a plain object representing the last recorded drop result. The drop targets may optionally specify it by returning an object from their `drop()` methods. When a chain of `drop()` is dispatched for the nested targets, bottom up, any parent that explicitly returns its own result from `drop()` overrides the child drop result previously set by the child. Returns `null` if called outside `endDrag()`.

- **`didDrop()`** Returns `true` if some drop target has handled the drop event, `false` otherwise. Even if a target did not return a drop result, `didDrop()` returns `true`. Use it inside `endDrag()` to test whether any drop target has handled the drop. Returns `false` if called outside `endDrag()`.

- **`getInitialClientOffset()`**: Returns the `{ x, y }` client offset of the pointer at the time when the current drag operation has started. Returns `null` if no item is being dragged.

- **`getInitialSourceClientOffset()`**: Returns the `{ x, y }` client offset of the drag source component's root DOM node at the time when the current drag operation has started. Returns `null` if no item is being dragged.

- **`getClientOffset()`**: Returns the last recorded `{ x, y }` client offset of the pointer while a drag operation is in progress. Returns `null` if no item is being dragged.

- **`getDifferenceFromInitialOffset()`**: Returns the `{ x, y }` difference between the last recorded client offset of the pointer and the client offset when the current drag operation has started. Returns `null` if no item is being dragged.

- **`getSourceClientOffset()`**: Returns the projected `{ x, y }` client offset of the drag source component's root DOM node, based on its position at the time when the current drag operation has started, and the movement difference. Returns `null` if no item is being dragged.
