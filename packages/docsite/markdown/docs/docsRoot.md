React DnD is a set of React utilities to help you build complex drag and drop interfaces while keeping your components decoupled. It is a perfect fit for apps like Trello and Storify, where dragging transfers data between different parts of the application, and the components change their appearance and the application state in response to the drag and drop events.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend
```

The second package will allow React DnD [the HTML5 drag and drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Drag_and_drop) under the hood. You may choose to use a third-party backend instead, such as [the touch backend](https://npmjs.com/package/react-dnd-touch-backend).

## What's It Look Like?

```jsx
// Let's make <Card text='Write the docs' /> draggable!

import React from 'react'
import { useDrag } from 'react-dnd'
import { ItemTypes } from './Constants'

/**
 * Your Component
 */
export default function Card({ text }) {
  const [{ opacity }, dragRef] = useDrag(
    () => ({
      type: ItemTypes.CARD,
      item: { text },
      collect: (monitor) => ({
        opacity: monitor.isDragging() ? 0.5 : 1
      })
    }),
    []
  )
  return (
    <div ref={dragRef} style={{ opacity }}>
      {text}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Features

### It works with your components

Instead of providing readymade widgets, React DnD wraps your components and injects props into them. If you use React Router or Flummox, you already know this pattern.

### It embraces unidirectional data flow

React DnD fully embraces the declarative rendering paradigm of React and doesn't mutate the DOM. It is a great complement to Redux and other architectures with the unidirectional data flow. In fact it is built on Redux.

### It hides the platform quirks

HTML5 drag and drop has an awkward API full of pitfalls and browser inconsistencies. React DnD handles them internally for you, so you can focus on developing your application instead of working around the browser bugs.

### It is extensible and testable

React DnD uses the HTML5 drag and drop under the hood, but it also lets you supply a custom “backend”. You can create a custom DnD backend based on the touch events, the mouse events, or something else entirely. For example, a built-in simulation backend lets you test drag and drop interaction of your components in a Node environment.

## Touch Support

For touch support, use React DnD with [the touch backend](https://npmjs.com/package/react-dnd-touch-backend) instead of the HTML5 backend.

## Non-Goals

React DnD gives you a set of powerful primitives, but it does not contain any readymade components. It's lower level than [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) or [interact.js](http://interactjs.io/) and is focused on getting the drag and drop interaction right, leaving its visual aspects such as axis constraints or snapping to you. For example, React DnD doesn't plan to provide a `Sortable` component. Instead it gives you the tools you need to build your own with any rendering customizations that you need.
