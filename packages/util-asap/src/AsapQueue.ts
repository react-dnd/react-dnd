// The message channel technique was discovered by Malte Ubl and was the
// original foundation for this library.
// http://www.nonblocking.io/2011/06/windownexttick.html

// Safari 6.0.5 (at least) intermittently fails to create message ports on a
// page's first load. Thankfully, this version of Safari supports
// MutationObservers, so we don't need to fall back in that case.

// function makeRequestCallFromMessageChannel(callback) {
//     var channel = new MessageChannel();
//     channel.port1.onmessage = callback;
//     return function requestCall() {
//         channel.port2.postMessage(0);
//     };
// }

// For reasons explained above, we are also unable to use `setImmediate`
// under any circumstances.
// Even if we were, there is another bug in Internet Explorer 10.
// It is not sufficient to assign `setImmediate` to `requestFlush` because
// `setImmediate` must be called *by name* and therefore must be wrapped in a
// closure.
// Never forget.

// function makeRequestCallFromSetImmediate(callback) {
//     return function requestCall() {
//         setImmediate(callback);
//     };
// }

// Safari 6.0 has a problem where timers will get lost while the user is
// scrolling. This problem does not impact ASAP because Safari 6.0 supports
// mutation observers, so that implementation is used instead.
// However, if we ever elect to use timers in Safari, the prevalent work-around
// is to add a scroll event listener that calls for a flush.

// `setTimeout` does not call the passed callback if the delay is less than
// approximately 7 in web workers in Firefox 8 through 18, and sometimes not
// even then.

// This is for `asap.js` only.
// Its name will be periodically randomized to break any code that depends on
// // its existence.
// rawAsap.makeRequestCallFromTimer = makeRequestCallFromTimer

// ASAP was originally a nextTick shim included in Q. This was factored out
// into this ASAP package. It was later adapted to RSVP which made further
// amendments. These decisions, particularly to marginalize MessageChannel and
// to capture the MutationObserver implementation in a closure, were integrated
// back into ASAP proper.
