React DnD website is based on the [fixed-data-table](https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table) website and uses its code with a permission.

View it on the web: http://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd

Run it locally:

```
npm install
npm start
```

After it builds the static site (might take about half a minute), open http://localhost:8080/.
