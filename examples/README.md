The examples are written using [ES7](http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs-faq.html#what-is-the-syntax-i-see-in-the-es7-code-examples-) and use [decorators](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators). You don't have to use the decorators for React DnD, they are completely optional. [The tutorial](http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs-tutorial.html) should give you a good idea about using React DnD in ES5, ES6, or ES7.

Check out the [hosted versions of this examples](http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/examples-chessboard-tutorial-app.html). To run them locally, clone the repo, and run `yarn install && yarn start`. It will take a while to start, but after the site is built, you can access the examples by opening [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and clicking “Examples” in the navigation bar.
